# Weather App
Weather Forecast API Integration:
The application fetches real-time weather data, including current conditions and a 5-day forecast, using an external weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap).

Dynamic Weather Display:

The current weather and forecast data are dynamically displayed on the front-end using HTML, and users can view detailed information for each day of the forecast by clicking on forecast cards.

Scalable Structure for Frontend and Backend:

The project follows Django's best practices for scalability, with separate static files (CSS, JS) for better performance and easier future expansion of features.

Form Submission for City Selection:

The application allows users to input their city in a search form, which triggers a POST request to fetch and display the relevant weather data.
